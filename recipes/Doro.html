    <h2>How Doro made of</h2>
    <p> <strong>DORO,</strong>Wat is one of Ethiopia's most iconic dishes, a rich and spicy chicken stew 
        often reserved for special occasions and celebrations. To make doro wat, start by preparing a generous 
        amount of berbere spice mix, which forms the heart of the dish. Begin cooking by slowly caramelizing
         a large quantity of finely chopped onions without oil until deeply golden. Add niter kibbeh (Ethiopian 
         spiced clarified butter) to the onions, followed by minced garlic and ginger, creating a fragrant base.

        Next, stir in the berbere spice and cook it briefly to enhance its flavor. Add chicken pieces, 
        traditionally bone-in and skin-on, to the pan, coating them in the spice mixture. Pour in some water 
        or chicken stock and simmer the stew slowly, allowing the flavors to meld and the chicken to become tender. 
        Hard-boiled eggs are often added towards the end of cooking, soaking up the flavorful sauce.
        
        Doro Wat is served on a large injera, with additional injera pieces used to scoop up the stew. Its deep,
         spicy flavors and tender chicken make it a centerpiece of Ethiopian cuisine, often enjoyed with family 
         and friends.
