    <h2>How Chechibsa made of</h2>
    <p> <strong>CHECHIBSA,</strong> a traditional Ethiopian dish, is a comforting and hearty meal made 
        from finely broken flatbread mixed with spiced clarified butter (niter kibbeh) and berbere spice. To prepare 
        chechibsa, start by baking a simple flatbread using flour, water, and a pinch of salt. Once baked, tear the 
        flatbread into small, bite-sized pieces. In a pan, melt niter kibbeh, a seasoned clarified butter infused with
         garlic, ginger, and aromatic spices. Stir in a generous amount of berbere spice to create a rich, flavorful 
         base. Add the broken pieces of flatbread to the pan and mix thoroughly, allowing the bread to absorb the spices 
         and butter. Serve warm, often accompanied by a side of fresh yogurt or honey for added flavor. Chechibsa is a 
         beloved breakfast or snack that embodies the rich culinary traditions of Ethiopia
